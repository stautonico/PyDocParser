# Guide on how to migrate from 2.0.0 to 2023.06.a

## Things that have changed

- The `Parser` class has been renamed to `Docparser`
- The `login()` method now returns `True` or `False`, removing the need to manually call `ping()` to
  check if the login was successful
- All methods that can fail now throw an `Exception` including the error text returned by the API
- The `upload_file_by_path()` method has been renamed to `upload_local_file_by_path()`
- The newly-renamed `upload_local_file_by_path()` method now optionally takes a `remote_id` argument (was previously
  mandatory)
- `upload_file_by_base64()` now optionally takes a `remote_id` argument (was previously mandatory)
- `upload_file_by_url()` now optionally takes a `remote_id` argument (was previously mandatory)
- `get_one_result()` now optionally takes a `include_children` argument
- `get_one_result()` no longer supports the `format` argument
- `get_multiple_results()` no longer supports the `format` argument

In order to migrate your code, you should:

- Replace all instances of `Parser` with `Docparser`
- Replace all instances of `upload_file_by_path()` with `upload_local_file_by_path()`

After that, your program should work as before!
